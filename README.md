# Artifical-Intelligence

## program 1 - BFS, IDS(IDDFS), A*
Implement and experiment with three searching strategies (BFS, IDS, and A*) by seeking a possible solution of reaching a target from origin in a 2D-coordination.

## program 2 (game project)
It is a "Five in a Row" game project, which includes:
- game-playing agent
  - implement by Minimax(Negamax) and Alpha-Beta pruning
- Chessboard displaying program
- judge program (provide by course)

## program 3 - Decision Tree & Random Forest
Implement a decision tree and afterward bulid a forest.
The experiments of random forest includes:
- Relative sizes of the training and validation subsets
- Number of trees in the forest
- Parameters used during tree induction, such as how many attributes to consider at each node splitting.
- Extremely random forest
